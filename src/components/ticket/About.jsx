          Event Ticket Booking UI ‚Äì Open Source Practice Project üéüÔ∏è Overview
        </p>

        <p>
          This is a beginner-friendly yet practical Event Ticket Booking UI
          designed for developers to clone, explore, and build upon. The design
          focuses on a seamless, login-free ticket reservation flow, allowing
          users to book event tickets quickly and efficiently.
        </p>

        <p>
          The project consists of a three-step ticket booking flow, and
          developers can extend it further by integrating payment solutions,
          user authentication (optional), and ticket validation systems.
